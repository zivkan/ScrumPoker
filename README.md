ScrumPoker
==========

During a planning meeting, two of my colleges joked that I will create a poker planning application in AngularJS.  So I did.


I used it as an exercise to learn AngularJS and SignalR. Before creating this application, I had zero experience with SignalR and my AngularJS experience was limited to reading the tutorial on their website.  Therefore this code doesn't use best practises. It probably doesn't even use good practises.
